# [DRAFT] API Gap Task Force Charter

The API Task Force is part of the W3C Web and Mobile Interest Group.  The Task Force's mission is to continuously review APIs on native mobile platforms and create use cases and requirements to support the creation of these APIs on the web. 

* Confidentiality: Proceedings are public
* TF Leader: TBD

## Scope

The API Gap Task Force is tasked with monitoring new and existing APIs on native mobile platforms.  

The goal of this is to allow the W3C to discover *which* APIs developers want and the functionality that users are expecting.  The W3C can then standardise these into the web platform. 

The task force will also be tasked with monitoring and documenting extensions and plugins to browsers which either offer functionality to mobile browsers or provide some mobile-browser functionality (e.g. remote debugging). 

The Task Force is further tasked with taking these APIs and creating use-cases and requirements documentation.  This will support the development of these standards by working groups of the W3C.

The tasks of the group include:

* Continuously monitoring native APIs for mobile platform
* Continuously monitoring plugins and extensions to mobile browsers which offer functionality above the current web platform
* Maintaining a list of common and newly popularised native platform APIs which are **not** part of the web platform
* Maintaining a list of API functions which appear in native APIs but **not** on the web platform
* Creating use-cases documents for new web APIs
* Creating requirements documents for new web APIs

## Deliverables
The Task Force will be tasked with:

- Maintaining a suite of documents which detail the API gap at various stages of the year
- Working on use-cases & requirements documents for these APIs.

### Continuous Work
This work will run continuously through the lifetime of the group.

* __Standards for Web Applications on Mobile:__ current state and roadmap (every year: Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
* __API Gap List:__ a document comparing the APIs and features available across various mobile platforms, and how web APIs and functionality compares (every year: Feb, May, Sep)
* __Plugins and Extensions List:__ a document which details influential and popular plugins to browsers.  This document will also analyse whether these could be constructed using existing web technologies and the reasons for/against inclusion in web standards (every year: Mar, Jun, Nov)
* __Gap Analysis:__ a document detailing the current gap analysis between native apps and web apps on mobile.  This will cover aspects including (but not limited to) networking, APIs, UI, device integration, communication and performance.  (every year: Mar, Oct).

### Specific Work
Every quarter the group will analyse the API Gap List to determine whether there is a native API or piece of functionality which we wish to bring to the web. 

The group will then create a document which analyses the native use cases, and create requirements based on these. A good example is the [Use Cases and Requirements for Installable Web Apps](http://w3c-webmob.github.io/installable-webapps/) document. 

## Communication
The group will maintain its work on GitHub and discuss important issues through the public Webmob mailing list [public-web-mobile@w3.org](public-web-mobile@w3.org).

Every month a dedicated Task Force call will be organised to discuss the deliverable(s) for that month, and what needs to be done. Issues dedicated to each deliverable will be added and maintained on the GitHub repository for each work item. If necessary, the group may hold a workshop at W3C events to go through and work on specific deliverables which may occur.
