# [DRAFT] API Gap Task Force Charter

The mission of the API Task Force, part of the W3C Web and Mobile Interest Group, is to continuously review new and standing APIs on native platforms for mobile as well as extensions and plugins to browsers and create use cases and requirements to support the creation of these APIs on the web platform. 

* Confidentiality: Proceedings are public
* TF Leader: TBD

## Scope

The API Gap Task Force is tasked with monitoring APIs on native platforms for mobile, new and existing, where APIs don't already exist for the web platform. The goal of this is to allow the Web and Mobile Interest Group, as well as other groups of the W3C to discover those APIs which developers want, and the functionality that users are expecting, so W3C can standardise these into the web platform. The task force will also be tasked with monitoring and documenting extensions and plugins to browsers which either offer functionality to mobile browsers or provide some mobile-browser functionality (e.g. remote debugging). 

The Task Force is further tasked with taking these APIs and creating use cases and requirements documentation to support the development of these standards by working groups of the W3C.

The tasks of the group include:

* Continously monitor native APIs for mobile platform
* Continously monitor plugins and extensions to mobile browsers which offer functionality above the current web platform
* Maintain a list of common and newly popularised native platform APIs which are not part of the web platform
* Maintain a list of API functions which appear in native APIs but not on the web platform
* Create use cases documents for new web APIs
* Create requirements documents for new web APIs

## Deliverables
The Task Force will be tasked with both maintaining a suite of documents which detail the API gap at various stages of the year and working on use cases / requirements documents for 

### Continuous Work
This work will run continuously through the lifetime of the group.

* __Standards for Web Applications on Mobile:__ current state and roadmap (every year: Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
* __API Gap List:__ a document used to compare the APIs and features available across various mobile platforms and analyses how web APIs and functionality compares (every year: Feb, May, Sep)
* __Plugins and Extensions List:__ a new work item which details influential and popular plugins to browsers and analyses whether these could be constructed using web technologies and the reasons for/against (every year: Mar, Jun, Nov)
* __Gap Analysis:__ a document detailing the current gap analysis between native apps and web apps on mobile, covering aspects from networking, APIs, UI, device integration, communication and perforamnce.  (every year: Mar, Oct).

### Specific Work
Every quarter the webmob group will analyse the API Gap List to determine whether there is a native API or piece of functionality which we wish to bring to the web. The group will then create a document which analyses the native use cases, and create requirements based on these. A good example is the Use [Cases and Requirements for Installable Web Apps](http://w3c-webmob.github.io/installable-webapps/) document. 

## Communication
The group will maintain it's work on Github and discuss important issues through the public Webmob mailing list [public-web-mobile@w3.org](public-web-mobile@w3.org). Every month a dedicated Task Force call will be organised to discuss the deliverable/s for that month, and what needs to be done. Issues dedicated to each deliverable will be added and maintained on the Github repository for each work item. If necessary, the group may hold a workshop to go through and work on specific deliverables which may occur at W3C events.
