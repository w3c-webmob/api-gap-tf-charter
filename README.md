# [DRAFT] API Gap Task Force Charter

The mission of the API Task Force, part of the W3C Web and Mobile Interest Group, is to continuously review new and standing APIs on native platforms for mobile as well as extensions and plugins to browsers and create use cases and requirements to support the creation of these APIs on the web platform. 

* Confidentiality: Proceedings are public
* TF Leader: TBD

## Scope

The API Gap Task Force is tasked with monitoring APIs on native platforms for mobile, new and existing, where APIs don't already exist for the web platform. The goal of this is to allow the Web and Mobile Interest Group, as well as other groups of the W3C to discover those APIs which developers want, and the functionality that users are expecting, so W3C can standardise these into the web platform. The task force will also be tasked with monitoring and documenting extensions and plugins to browsers which either offer functionality to mobile browsers or provide some mobile-browser functionality (e.g. remote debugging). 

The Task Force is further tasked with taking these APIs and creating use cases and requirements documentation to support the development of these standards by working groups of the W3C.

The tasks of the group include:

* Continously monitor native APIs for mobile platform
* Continously monitor plugins and extensions to mobile browsers which offer functionality above the current web platform
* Maintain a list of common and newly popularised native platform APIs which are not part of the web platform
* Maintain a list of API functions which appear in native APIs but not on the web platform
* Create use cases documents for new web APIs
* Create requirements documents for new web APIs

## Deliverables
The Task Force will ...

* Gap Analysis
* Apps Taxonomy
* Plugins and Extensions list
* Debugging Tools
* Use Case Documents
* Requirements Documents

## Communication
The current expectation is that most of the work will happen on the Web and Mobile Interest Group public-web-mobile@w3.org list, supported by the usage of Github repositories as needed.
